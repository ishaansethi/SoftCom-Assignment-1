MUMBAI: Shiv Sena MPSanjay Rauton Monday, referring to the incident in whichWest Bengalchief ministerMamata Banerjeedid not deliver her speech "in protest" on Netaji Bose's birthday in Kolkata after 'Jai Shree Ram' slogans were raised, said that nobody should feel ashamed of the slogans.

"Secularism of the nation is not threatened by the chanting ofJai Shri Ramslogans. Nobody should feel ashamed by the chanting of the slogans. I believe that Mamata ji also believes in God Ram," said Raut while addressing reporters.

This comes after Mamata Banerjee on January 23 said that "government program should have some dignity" and "it is not fair to insult somebody whom you have invited" after slogans of 'Jai Shri Ram' were raised at the Kolkata event where she was invited to speak.

A visibly upset Mamata Banerjee said it was a government programme and not that of a political party. The event was presided over by Prime MinisterNarendra Modi.

Political debates related to West Bengal have heated up due to the upcoming West Bengal elections.

Elections to 294 assembly seats in West Bengal are slated to take place in a next few months.

On January 17, Shiv Sena announced that it would also contest the West Bengal assembly elections.
