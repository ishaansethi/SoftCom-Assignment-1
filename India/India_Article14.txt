NEW DELHI:CongressleaderRahul Gandhion Monday slammed theNarendra Modigovernment for its policy on China and said that the neighbouring country is expanding its occupation into Indian territory.

Gandhi attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said the PM does not have the courage to say the word 'China' and has not used the neighbouring country's name in his speeches for the past few months.



Rahul Gandhi's remark comes amid another report of an India-China troops clash at Naku La in Sikkim.

The Indian and Chinese troops physically clashed in the high-altitude area in north Sikkim last week, with several injuries being sustained on both sides, even as the nine-month-long eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation continues in eastern Ladakh despite several rounds of diplomatic and military talks.

The Army, however, said it was “a minor face-off” that took place at Naku La on January 20, which was “resolved by local commanders as per established protocols”.

On Sunday, while interacting with weavers in Odanilai of Erode district ofTamil Nadu, the former Congress president blamed India's 'weak economy' for Chinese intrusion and said that China has understood that Indian economy is on its knees, and every action of our government is designed to strengthen five-six big business people.

"You must have read that the Chinese army is occupying the Indian Territory, and many people say that Bangladesh is competing very strongly in the textile industry. Now, one has to ask why China thinks it has the guts to come inside Indian territory? It has not happened before. China can see that that India is weak," he said.
