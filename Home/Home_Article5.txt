PURSURAH (WB): WestBengalchief ministerMamata Banerjeeon Monday lashed out at theBJP, accusing it of insultingNetaji Subhas Chandra Boseby raising 'Jai Shri Ram' slogans at an event to mark the icon's 125th birth anniversary.

Branding the BJP as a group of "outsiders" and "Bharat Jalao Party", she said it has been continuously insulting the icons of Bengal,Netajibeing the "latest addition to the list".

"Would you invite anyone to your house and then insult the person? Is this the culture of Bengal or our country? I would have had no problem if slogans hailing Netaji were raised.

"But they didn't do that. To taunt me, they shouted slogans which had no relation to the programme. I was insulted in front of the prime minister of the country. This is their (BJP) culture," theTrinamool Congressboss told a rally here.

Banerjee had on Saturday refused to speak at an official event attended by Prime MinisterNarendra Modito observe Subhas Chandra Bose's 125th birth anniversary, after 'Jai Shri Ram' chants greeted her.

Dubbing turncoats in her party as "betrayers", she said those who have deserted theTMCin the run-up to the assembly polls will never be welcomed back.

"The ones who left knew they would not be getting tickets in the coming elections. It is good they exited, or else we would have thrown them out... Those who want to leave the party should do that as early as possible," Banerjee added.
