BENGALURU:Launchesand sales of residential projects almost halved in Bengaluru in the second half of last year compared to the year before, a report fromKnight Frankshowed, but sequentially the fall was much less suggesting that the worst shock from the pandemic is perhaps behind the sector.

Launches dipped to 9,123 units from 12,878 while sales dropped to 11,402 units from 19.851. It was 10,806 and 12,177 units respectively in the first half of the year.

"While the pandemic and associated lockdown disturbances have left an impression on 2020performanceof Bengaluru residential market, the city made a meaningful return in Q4 with a 32% QoQ improvement in home sales,” Shantanu Mazumder, senior branch director of Knight Frank in Bengaluru, said.

The fourth quarter saw an improvement in sales performance compared to the previous 4-5 months with sales up 32% sequentially. Residential sales have reached 54 % of the pre-COVID level. Due to the pandemic,consumersnow want to own bigger and better houses.

With consumer preference shifting towards ready to move houses, developers have restrained new project launches in this year and reoriented operational and financial bandwidth towards completion of ongoing projects. The recurring spate of sales compared to launches have affected a gradual decline in the inventory level in the city. On an annual basis, unsold inventory is down 5% to 74,764 housing units as at end of 2020.

South Bengaluru saw the highest quantum of homes sold in H2 2020 of 3,860 units followed by east with 3,750 units. South Bengaluru also registered maximum home launches to 3,740 units during the period.
